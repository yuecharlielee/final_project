RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 BMG0/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[1].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM18.ram has an input control pin BMG0/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[1].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM18.ram/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: BMG0/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[1].ram.r/prim_init.ram/addra[13]) which is driven by a register (pc/y_1_reg[2]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
